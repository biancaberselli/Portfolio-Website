                <h3>The Oximeter</h3>
                <p> An oximeter is a device responsible for measuring the user's blood oxygen levels. As a self-directed project, it allowed me to master my hardware, soldering, and software skills. The project was completed during Summer 2021 in order to increase my exposure to soldering, since remote learning limited such opportunities.

        <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--work">And its Hardware Functions</p>
        <div class="it-work__body">
            <p>The prototype was designed using an Arduino Nano, an Oled Display, and a MAX30100 heart sensor. It was initially built on a breadboard to comprehend the wiring system between each element, and later soldered to improve connectivity in the nodes after uploading the code in the Arduino.
            </p>
            <p> The OLED display was unresponsive when the circuit was powered on. Nonetheless, the project allowed me to gain exposure to new obstacles I had never encountered. I mastered the ability to work in a self-directed and self-taught manner while maintaing exceptional organizational skills. The project overall expanded my passion for hardware prototypes and my curiosity for learning more about various possible functions using circuitry.
