                <h3>The BuzzBand</h3>
                <p> The Buzzband is a wearable device designed to alert animals of your presence by radiating sound frequencies, to avoid unexpected encounters. Sound waves are emitted constantly at a frequency of 22kHz, over a 50 yard distance. The prototype will not cause sound pollution to the hiker, thus not hindering the outdoor experience.
                </p>
                <p>The device will be composed of features such as a 10-14 hour battery life, an adjustable band, and an emergency call button, and an LED system to communicate with the user.</p>

        <div class="it-work__body">
            <p id="one_text">The breadboard design consists of a voltage converter to convert 12V from the wall input to 5V. It uses a non-isolated DC switching regulator and two capacitors. 
            </p>
            <p id="two_text">To control the LED system, the PIC18F27/47/57Q43 microcontroller is used to communicate with its registers using the C programming language, and ensure that the green LED turns on when the 22 kHz is being outputted, and the red LED turns on when it’s not working successfully. Two resistors are connected between the LEDs and the microcontroller’s registers, in order to limit the current through each LED to prevent from burning them out.
            </p>
            <p id="three_text">The volume of the output is controlled by a potentiometer and the TL4112 OpAmp. The potentiometer provides a range of resistances from 0-200 kΩ.
            </p>
            <p id="four_text">The output from the potentiometer is safely connected to the input of the speaker.
            </p>
            <p>The buzzband's digital prototype is illustrated below, and its physical prototype is located at the right.</p>
